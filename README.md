Videotron Internet Usage Monitor Widget for Mac
===============================================

Whats is it?
------------

Quite simply, this is a Mac Dashboard widget that allows Videotron.com customers
to monitor their monthly bandwidth quota.

Features
--------

The widget will display the following:

* when your billing month started;
* the amount of upload and download you made thus far, this month;
* a graph of you current usage versus your allowed usage;
* a hint about where you stand on your daily quota usage: did you download too much, or not enough, since the beginning of your billing month, to end the month with your quota used at 100%?;
* the last updated date.

How it works?
-------------
Every 6 hours, the extension sends an HTTP request to the Videotron Public API.

This API has been developed by Videotron to provide to third-party developers the data necessary to display bandwidth usage for Videotron customers.

How to use?
-----------

Download the widget from [my blog](http://www.pommepause.com/blog/2010/01/mac-widget-videotron-internet-usage-monitor/) and simply double-click it to install.

Then go in the options (click the round i icon in the lower-right corder), and enter your Videotron User Key.
